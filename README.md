# pi-E-inkDisplay
shows the current silver price, the change of it over the last 7 days, the profit on your bought Silver, how much silver you have, the IP of the device its running on and the address for a local apache web-server on an e-ink display.

The script uses WiringPi.

I made this project for personal use so don't expect much documentation.
